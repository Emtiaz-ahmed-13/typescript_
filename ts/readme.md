‚ö° TypeScript: JavaScript with Superpowers ‚ö°
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that provides powerful features for building larger and more complex applications. It extends JavaScript by adding static typing and additional tools to help developers write cleaner, more reliable code. With TypeScript, you can enjoy all the flexibility of JavaScript while benefiting from better error detection, improved code readability, and enhanced tooling support.

‚úçÔ∏è Annotations
TypeScript allows you to specify type annotations for variables, function parameters, return values, and other expressions. These annotations ensure that values adhere to the expected data types, making it easier to catch errors early in the development process. By enforcing types, TypeScript helps developers write safer and more predictable code, making debugging and scaling applications much smoother.

üîç Type Inference
Type inference is a feature in TypeScript that allows the compiler to automatically determine the type of a variable based on its value. In other words, if you declare a variable without explicitly specifying its type, TypeScript will try to infer the type based on the value you assign to it.

Any Type

Typescript has a special any type that can be used to represent any type.when a variable is annotated with the any type,Typescrpt will allow it to have any value and disable all type checking for that variable and its properties.
