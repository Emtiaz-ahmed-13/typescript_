TypeScript: JavaScript with Superpowers
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that provides powerful features for building larger and more complex applications. It extends JavaScript by adding static typing and additional tools to help developers write cleaner, more reliable code. With TypeScript, you can enjoy all the flexibility of JavaScript while benefiting from better error detection, improved code readability, and enhanced tooling support.

Annotations
TypeScript allows you to specify type annotations for variables, function parameters, return values, and other expressions. These annotations make it easier to catch errors early in the development process by ensuring that values adhere to the expected data types. By enforcing these types, TypeScript helps developers write safer and more predictable code, making debugging and scaling applications much smoother.
